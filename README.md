Track / Format:	Game Career Seminar

Overview:	What better way to improve your own games than by building on the successes and failures of those who have come before you? This session highlights the development of three games from three different approaches. Tim Staton-Davis will discuss the triple-A title 'Middle-Earth: Shadow of War', specifically from his perspective as designer. William Pugh and Jan Stroetmann will take a decidedly unique approach when dissecting their indie nightmare adventure comedy 'Accounting+' (you'll have to see it in person). Lastly, students Kai Nyame and Milo Smiley will demonstrate their unique live-action game 'Ideal Meal', which allowed them to showcase at E3 and Indiecade.
