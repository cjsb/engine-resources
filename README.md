**Company Name(s):**	Goodbye Kansas, Glu Mobile, TRU LUV, Riot Games

**Overview:**	Game development is more than the mere developing of games. The industry is still young, and sometimes immature. As individuals, developers can be fragile and frail, sometimes more enthusiastic than realistic. They build circles of trust out of necessity among family and friends, but can't always think further than the next project. This session will talk a bit about the long term perspective, "the long run", about a full (and long) life in game development. The speaker will discuss how developers as individuals, as companies and as a community, can support and encourage life-long careers in game development.

But being a new developer can also be daunting, confusing, and full of uncertainty on how to harness all of that energy.While a myriad of resources exist to learn the various tools, languages, processes, and other aspects of a particular discipline, it's also important to practice a variety of soft skills. Learning how to successfully navigate professional relationships and becoming a well-rounded individual can help you quickly level-up your career.

William Pugh and Jan Stroetmann will take a decidedly unique approach when dissecting their indie nightmare adventure comedy 'Accounting+' (you'll have to see it in person). Lastly, students Kai Nyame and Milo Smiley will demonstrate their unique live-action game 'Ideal Meal', which allowed them to showcase at E3 and Indiecade.

### Programming

* [Procedurally Crafting Manhattan for 'Marvel's Spider-Man'](https://gdcvault.com/play/1025765), David Santiago, Insomniac Games

* [Raising Atreus for Battle in 'God of War'](https://gdcvault.com/play/1025768)

**Speaker(s):**	Hayato Yoshidome

**Company Name(s):**	Sony Santa Monica Studio

**Overview:**	'God of War' is a new beginning for Kratos as well as for the Sony Santa Monica development team. While Kratos struggled to build a meaningful relationship with his son, this talk will detail how the development team worked to make Atreus a fully realized companion AI. From conception through several approaches and iterations, how do you maintain Kratos' iconic combat style while making Atreus feel vital and important to gameplay? How do you do all of this while simultaneously reimagining Kratos' style of combat from the ground up? Delving into the different archetypes explored, as well as pitfalls to each iteration along the way, this talk will take attendees through the process of designing and building a compelling AI that is as integral to the gameplay as he is to the story.

* [Everyone Watching This Is Fired](https://gdcvault.com/play/1025778)

**Speaker(s):**	Mike Acton

**Company Name(s):**	Unity Technologies

**Overview:**	Mike presents some broad, sweeping, and perhaps unfair, generalizations about programmers in the industry. He then shares his expectations for what it would mean to strive to be among the very best programmers in the field. Specifically the technical, individual and team skills required for any programmer to solve the hard problems before them. For those programmers where good enough just isn't, and that want to take control of their own learning and careers, but just need to know what their next steps should practically be to have a bigger impact.
