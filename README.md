As individuals, developers can be fragile and frail, sometimes more enthusiastic than realistic. They build circles of trust out of necessity among family and friends, but can't always think further than the next project. This session will talk a bit about the long term perspective, "the long run", about a full (and long) life in game development. The speaker will discuss how developers as individuals, as companies and as a community, can support and encourage life-long careers in game development.
